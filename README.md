# Network Dynamics and Learning
## What's that?
This is a project where I am storing all the material of this academic course. which is about **graphs, statistics and AI**.
<p>It is very cool indeed.</p>

## What's inside?
- Labs already done by professors
- Labs done by me, in progress. They have a similar name.
- Theory book, with highligths and notes. The first 11 chapters.
- Homeworks, which I do as soon as I undestand that part of theory and labs.

## Will it be ever public?
Yes! as soon as I finish the Homeworks, I will publish them, after deleting all the labs, and theory, which should remain private.
